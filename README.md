# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Deployment

This project is automatically deployed to Vercel. Any changes pushed to the main branch will trigger a new deployment.

## Environment Variables

This application requires the following environment variables:

```
# API URL
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://back-mercadotiendas.onrender.com/api

# Firebase Configuration
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-sender-id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
```

## Password Recovery Flow

The application includes a password recovery system that works as follows:

1. User requests password reset on the login page
2. User enters their email address
3. Backend sends a recovery email with a token
4. User clicks the link in the email and is directed to the password reset page
5. User enters a new password
6. Password is updated in the system

For this flow to work in production, the backend needs the following environment variables:

```
# Frontend URL for recovery links
FRONTEND_URL=https://front-mercadotiendas.vercel.app

# Email Service Configuration
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.example.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your-email@example.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-email-password
```
